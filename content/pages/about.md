I enjoy programming with a spatial bent, primarily in Python, increasingly in JavaScript. I work mostly in ArcGIS using arcpy, but enjoy making maps with postgis, d3, mapnik, mapbox, leaflet and cartodb.

I have worked for nine years as a GIS Analyst (currently at HDR) in multiple domains, including environmental remediation, locating military munitions using remote sensing (LiDAR, orthophotography, magnetics), cultural resource surveys, and marine species surveys.
